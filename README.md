Teesside Basketball League iPhone app
=====================================

In early 2012 I decided to write an iPhone app to accompany the [Teesside Basketball League website](http://www.philjhale.com/2011/10/teesside-basketball-league.html) I created in the few years before. The app showed much of the information that was on the site including standings, results, fixtures and teams.

Sadly the league is no longer running and the app is no longer on the app store. I blogged about my [experiences building the app](http://www.philjhale.com/2012/05/on-iphone-development.html).
